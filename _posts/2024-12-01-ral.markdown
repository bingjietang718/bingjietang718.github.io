We present FORGE, a method that enables sim-to-real transfer of contact-rich manipulation policies in the presence of significant pose uncertainty. FORGE combines a force-threshold mechanism with a dynamics randomization scheme during policy learning in simulation, to enable the robust transfer of the learned policies to the real robot.
